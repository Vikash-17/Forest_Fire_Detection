# Forest Fire Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to detect forest fires from images using deep learning techniques. By classifying images into **fire** and **no fire**, it provides an automated approach to support early wildfire detection and prevention systems.

## Project Tasks
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics
- Visualization of predictions on test images

## Major Libraries and Framework
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning model building
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization of results
- **OpenCV** – Image processing

## Future Goals
- Improve model accuracy using advanced architectures (CNN variants, transfer learning)
- Deploy as a real-time web/mobile application for fire monitoring
- Integrate with IoT and satellite data for practical wildfire detection systems
