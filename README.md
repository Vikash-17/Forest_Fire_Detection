Forest Fire Detection-
Introduction

This project aims to detect forest fires from images using deep learning techniques. By classifying images into fire and no fire, it provides an automated approach to support early wildfire detection and prevention systems.

Project Tasks

1. Data preprocessing and augmentation

2. Model training and validation

3. Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

4. Visualization of predictions on test images

Major Libraries and Framework

1. TensorFlow / Keras – Deep learning model building

2. NumPy & Pandas – Data handling and preprocessing

3. Matplotlib – Visualization of results

4. OpenCV – Image processing

Future Goals Regarding this Project

1. Improve model accuracy using advanced architectures (CNN variants, transfer learning)

2. Deploy as a real-time web/mobile application for fire monitoring

3. Integrate with IoT and satellite data for practical wildfire detection systems
